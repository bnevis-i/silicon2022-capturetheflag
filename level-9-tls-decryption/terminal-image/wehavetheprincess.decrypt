Dear Mario and Luigi,
As you may now be aware, we've been watching your operation for some time and were informed of your latest discovery.
We simply cannot allow for Mario Bros Plumbing to take control of the market and prevent us from domination.
So, we've taken Princess Toadstool. I like the idea so much that I might even start developing this corrosion prevention myself. Bwahahahaha!!

Sincerely,
Your toughest competition - Bowser
