# Level - 11 - Bowser Fight

## Flag 1

There are 2 ways to retrieve the flag for level 11.

The first is to simply defeat bowser. There are plenty of level 8-4 walkthroughs available on youtube to show which pipes to go through. It's difficult to defeat him as "little" Mario, so it's suggested to make it through as Fire Mario. The hammer thrower and Bowser himself can be taken out with fire.

The second way is to dissect the javascript. In the maps.js file is a function called "z()" which returns the flag. It's been encrypted the key is found there as well. If this is decrypted with AES then the flag is found.
